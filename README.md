# Design Patterns in Java

Welcome Here!

The intent of this repo is to provide examples for each of the [23 Gang of Four design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## The Catalog of Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

* [x] [Abstract Factory]()
* [x] [Builder]()
* [x] [Factory Method]()
* [x] [Prototype]()
* [x] [Singleton]()

### Structural Patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures
flexible and efficient.

* [x] [Adapter]()
* [x] [Bridge]()
* [x] [Composite]()
* [x] [Decorator]()
* [x] [Facade]()
* [x] [Flyweight]()
* [x] [Proxy]()

### Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

* [x] [Chain of Responsibility]()
* [x] [Command]()
* [x] [Interpreter]()
* [x] [Iterator]()
* [x] [Mediator]()
* [x] [Memento]()
* [x] [Observer]()
* [x] [State]()
* [x] [Strategy]()
* [x] [Template Method]()
